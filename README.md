# ImageClassificationDeepLearning
Here I will show how to loop through a folder containing multiple images and classifying them using Keras and Pre-trained Netowrks.

Our brains make vision seem easy. It doesn't take any effort for humans to tell apart a lion and a jaguar, read a sign, or recognize a human's face. But these are actually hard problems to solve with a computer: they only seem easy because our brains are incredibly good at understanding images.

SEVERAL PRE-TRAINED NETWORKS :

- VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, Inception V3, and Xception

State-of-the-art deep learning image classifiers in Keras

Keras ships out-of-the-box with five Convolutional Neural Networks that have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset:
VGG16
VGG19
ResNet50
Inception V3
Xception


Inception V3


The goal of the inception module is to act as a “multi-level feature extractor” by computing 1×1, 3×3, and 5×5 convolutions within the same module of the network — the output of these filters are then stacked along the channel dimension and before being fed into the next layer in the network.
The original incarnation of this architecture was called GoogLeNet, but subsequent manifestations have simply been called Inception vN where N refers to the version number put out by Google.
